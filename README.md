Largely based off this tutorial by Talk2 Amareswaran: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxebTn_a930

A few changes...

Instead of MySQL, using H2

data.sql file provided to generate tables and insert test data. The queries differ slighly from Talk2 Amareswaran's because this program uses H2 instead of MySQL. Review that file for a note explaining why some values are true that would expect to be false, given the column and property names.
